# Space

To reduce decisions and increase consistency, there is a limited palette of spaces available within Clockface. Based on an `8px` scale and multiplied up/down, a set of 't-shirt sizes' have been created. Whether you're laying out a page, or creating padding in a new component, every space should snap to one of these values.

By sharing the same space foundations between design and development, it should become easier to translate between Figma and code. Below are the spaces and their SCSS variables:

<!-- STORY -->

---

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->
