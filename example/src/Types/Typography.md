# Typography

Typography in Clockface is built upon: [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator?c=320,14,1.125,1372,14,1.2,6,1,&s=0.75|0.5|0.25,1.5|2|3|4|6,s-l), a system for ensuring visual harmony at any viewport. Using two different typographic scales at a small/large viewport, the browser calculates the specific step sizes depending on the size of the window.

All typography within Clockface, or within any application depending on this design system, should use these sizes to prevent CSS creep and inconsistencies. Steps must be used as they are, and not multiplied/divided or combined with em's.

These responsive sizes can be applied with the following SCSS variables:

<!-- STORY -->

---

<!-- STORY HIDE START -->

<!-- STORY HIDE END -->
